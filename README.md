# Concerto

Concerto is a set of tools to analyse SSL/TLS datasets.  In
particular, it can extract, analyse and browse certificates and
chains.


# Ongoing support

Concerto has been originally developed at ANSSI, but new releases are
not provided by the agency anymore.

Therefore, anyone who wishes to get upstream versions of the project
must visit https://github.com/picty/concerto as this page now
**only serves archive purposes**.


# Project archives

ANSSI is providing the last stable commited version of concerto as an archive on this website:

  * [concerto-0.3.tar.gz](releases/concerto-0.3.tar.gz)
